# Coffee-Snake
The project is a Java to Python cross-compiler. This software can be used by anyone with basic java skills and would be a valuable tool for those who are new to Python. There would be a UI that would take in the Java code, verify compilation is error-free, run it through a parser, and displays the resulting Python code output in the UI.
